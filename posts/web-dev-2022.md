I created my first website in the mid-90's on Geocities using Netscape Navigator on a desktop PC running Windows 95. 

Now I am here in 2022 making a website with NextJS using VS Code on a Razer gamping laptop running Windows 11. 

I think back to the early social networks of the internet. MySpace, Friendster, Xanga...

Now we're on Zoom, Twitter Spaces, and everyone has an .eth subdomain on their handle.

I watched the first 54 minutes of the new Matrix Resurrections film. Surprisingly watchable after all of the negative reviews I'd read on Twitter.
