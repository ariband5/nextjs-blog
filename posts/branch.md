Git was developed in 2005 by Linus Torvalds, the creator of Linux. 

Version control allows you to track all changes being made, make backups, and keep the history allowing you to roll back in case something goes wrong.

## Useful Git Commands:

- git init
- git add { filename }
- git commit -m "Message"
- git push origin { branch name }
- git checkout { branch name }
- git checkout -b { branch name }
- git pull origin { branch }
- git status


That's a wrap!
